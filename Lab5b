// Problem Description:  Raymond wants to enter Law School after he graduates from State University. However, he must pass an entrance exam before he can be admitted. Write a program to help Raymond process his test scores. First, read in the expected total score he must meet in order to be admitted. Next, read in the scores from each section of the test. Continue to read in section scores until the user enters -7 for a score. Next, read in the question type (R/r - reading, L/l - Logic, A/a - Analytical). Compute and display Raymondâ€™s total score. Also display a message indicated his law school score status. Determine and display his lowest score. Display a message - i.e. Logic (score) was less than/greater than Analytic (score)- stating which question type scored the most points (Logic or Analytical).
