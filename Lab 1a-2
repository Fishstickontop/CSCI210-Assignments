// Problem Description: Francine, the ACM treasurer, needs to know how much money is needed for the annual pizza party. A large pizza has 8 slices and costs $7.99 (local sales tax is 9.5 percent). Write an app to help her. The app should read in the number of people invited to the party and the average number of slices per person. Determine and print the number pizzas needed for the people invited to the party and the cost for these pizzas (including tax) (format, $, accurate to 2 decimal places).
// This program will calculate the number of pizzas needed and total cost of pizzas after tax based on the amount of people and the average slices per person
