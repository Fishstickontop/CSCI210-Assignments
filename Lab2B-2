/ Problem Description: Michael is considering changing his TV service. His current service, (character (B/b - Barter),  charges a monthly base rate of $55.95 plus $6.50 per premium channel. He is thinking about switching to another TV service (T/t - Tish)  that charges a monthly base rate of $40.99 plus and $11.50 for each premium channel. Help him decide which service to use. Write an app that allows the user to enter the TV service (character), expected number of premium channels, and target monthly payment. Calculate and print the cost for the TV service selected. If the cost of the TV service is within his target monthly payment, display the message “Use this service” and the TV service name (Barter or Tish), otherwise, display “Use the other TV service.” and the TV service name (Barter or Tish).
// This program will display if the tv service selected is more than the target price and which service should be used.
